 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430FR59xx Demo - ADC12, Using an External Reference
//
//  Description: This example shows how to use an external positive reference for
//  the ADC12.The external reference is applied to the VeREF+ pin. AVss is used
//  for the negative reference. A single conversion is performed on channel A0.
//  The conversion results are stored in ADC12MEM0. Test by applying a voltage
//  to channel A0, then setting and running to a break point at the "_NOP()"
//  instruction. To view the conversion results, open an SFR window in debugger
//  and view the contents of ADC12MEM0 or from the variable ADCvar.
//  NOTE: VeREF+ range: 1.4V (min) to AVCC (max)
//        VeREF- range: 0V (min) to 1.2V (max)
//        Differential ref voltage range: 1.4V(min) to AVCC(max)
//          (see datasheet for device specific information)
